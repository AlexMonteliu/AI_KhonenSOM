# KhonenSOM
EN: This Python-programmed project implements a Kohonen Map, also known as the Kohonen Self-Organizing Neural Network. It's a type of unsupervised learning neural network primarily utilized for performing clustering tasks. Its main goal is to discover patterns and relationships in input data without the need for prior labels or categories. In this case, we group a map of RGB color pixels.

For its successful implementation, we have had to fine-tune the respective hyperparameters using various techniques and visualizations to avoid overfitting and underfitting, ensuring that the network generalizes correctly.
